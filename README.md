  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Resize(
        builder: () {

## Responsive Height and Width

Using `.h` and `.w`, let you to create adaptive widgets that suits on every device.

### Example

```dart
...
Container(
    // End result will be similar in every device
    height: 100.h,
    width: 100.w,
)
...
```

---

## ViewHeight and viewWidth

By using `.vh` and `.vw`, you can refer to the size of the screen and create widgets that are certain % of the screen size.

### Example

```dart
...
Container(
    height: 20.vh, // 20% of the screen height
    width: 50.vw, // 50% of the screen width
)
...
```

## Font Size

You can create scalable font sizes using `.sp` and by using `.rem` you can create font size as like in css.

### `.sp`

`.sp` will act as a scalable font size.

```dart
Text(
    "Your Text",
    style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 24.sp, // will scale according to the device
    ),
)
```

You can turn off scaling by setting `allowtextScaling` property in Resize().

```dart
...
return Resize(
    ...
    allowtextScaling: false,
    ...
);
```

### `.rem`

`.rem` will works as like in rem of css. By default the base size is set to 16.0 and can be overwritten.

```dart
Text(
    "Your Text",
    style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 1.2.rem, // will scale according to the device
    ),
)
```

You can change the base size property in Resize().

```dart
...
return Resize(
    ...
    baseForREM: <your value>, // will be referrenced when you use rem.
    // If set to 32. 1.25.rem will return 40.
    ...
);
```
